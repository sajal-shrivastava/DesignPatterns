## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Structural Design Patterns

---

### 2.1 Adapter Design Pattern

---

### üìñ Definition

The **Adapter Design Pattern** is a **structural pattern** that allows objects with **incompatible interfaces** to work together by **wrapping** one of the objects with an adapter class.
**In Simple Words**: It helps two classes work together even if they have different ways of doing things, using an adapter ‚Äî a middle layer that converts one class‚Äôs output into a format the other understands.

---

### üéØ Intent

> Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.

---

### üîß Example in This Project

In this project:

* `WeighingMachineBabies` returns weight in **pounds**
* The client expects weight in **kilograms**

To resolve this mismatch:

* `AdapterImpl` adapts `WeighingMachineBabies` to the `WeighingMachineAdapter` interface.
* The adapter internally **converts pounds to kilograms** so the client gets the expected format.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Components

| Class Name               | Role             | Description                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `WeighingMachineBabies`  | Adaptee          | Returns weight in pounds                |
| `WeighingMachineAdapter` | Target Interface | Expected by the client (returns kg)     |
| `AdapterImpl`            | Adapter          | Converts pounds to kilograms            |
| `ClientClass`            | Client           | Uses the adapter to access weight in kg |

---

### üìê Conversion Formula

```
kilograms = pounds √ó 0.453592
```

---

üß™ **Example Output:**

```bash
Weight In kg: 20.41164
```

---

### 2.2 Facade Design Pattern

---

### üìñ Definition

The **Facade Design Pattern** is a **structural pattern** that provides a **simplified interface** to a complex subsystem. It hides the complexity of the system by encapsulating it behind a single unified interface.

---

### üéØ Intent

> Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. The Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

---

### üîß Example in This Project

In this project:

* The home theatre system includes **three subsystems**:

    * `DVDPlayer`
    * `SoundSystem`
    * `Projector`

To simplify their usage:

* `HomeTheatreSystem` acts as a **facade** that wraps these subsystems.
* It exposes simple methods:

    * `turnOnTheatre()` ‚Üí Turns on all devices
    * `turnOffTheatre()` ‚Üí Turns off all devices

The client interacts only with `HomeTheatreSystem` and not individual components.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Components

| Class Name          | Role      | Description                                    |
| ------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `DVDPlayer`         | Subsystem | Manages DVD operations (on, off, play)         |
| `SoundSystem`       | Subsystem | Manages audio system operations                |
| `Projector`         | Subsystem | Manages projector operations                   |
| `HomeTheatreSystem` | Facade    | Wraps all subsystems behind a single interface |
| `Client`            | Client    | Interacts only with the Facade class           |

---

üß™ **Example Output:**

```bash
Press On key and start watching movie
DVD Player On
Projector On
SoundSystem On
Home theatre is on
Press OFF key and turn off home theatre
DVD Player Off
Projector Off
SoundSystem Off
Home theatre is off
```

---

### 2.3 Decorator Design Pattern

---

### üìñ Definition

The **Decorator Design Pattern** is a **structural pattern** that allows you to **dynamically add new behavior or responsibilities** to an object without modifying its code.
**In Simple Words**: You wrap an object with another object (a decorator) to enhance or modify its behavior.

---

### üéØ Intent

> Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

---

### üîß Example in This Project

In this project:

* `Pizza` is the core component interface.
* `FarmhousePizza` is a concrete implementation.
* `CheeseDecorator`, `OliveDecorator`, etc., are decorators that add toppings dynamically without changing the original pizza code.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Components

| Class Name        | Role                | Description                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Pizza`           | Component           | The core abstraction                  |
| `FarmhousePizza`  | Concrete Component  | The base pizza                        |
| `Decorator`       | Decorator Interface | Implements Pizza, wraps another Pizza |
| `CheeseDecorator` | Concrete Decorator  | Adds cheese topping                   |
| `PizzaStore`      | Client              | Builds pizza using decorators         |

---

üß™ **Example Output:**

```bash
Pizza's Cost: 320
```

*Here, base pizza = ‚Çπ300 and cheese topping = ‚Çπ20.*

## üß† Summary

| Pattern   | Intent                                    | Simplifies                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |

| Facade    | Provide a unified interface to subsystems | Subsystem usage for clients                |
| Decorator | Add functionality without changing code   | Dynamically enrich behavior of an object   |

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Compile and run the `main()` methods in:

    * `ClientClass` (for Adapter)
    * `Client` (for Facade)
    * `PizzaStore` (for Decorator)

Or via terminal:

```bash
javac org/example/structuralpatterns/**/*/*.java
java org.example.structuralpatterns.AdapterPattern.ClientClass
java org.example.structuralpatterns.FacadePattern.Client.Client
java org.example.structuralpatterns.DecoratorPattern.Client.PizzaStore
```
